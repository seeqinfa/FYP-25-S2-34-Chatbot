# Project Restructure Complete

Your project has been restructured to use the `web/` directory as the root for Railway deployment.

## What Changed:

### 1. New Directory Structure:
```
/
├── web/                    <- New root directory for Railway
│   ├── index.php          <- Main entry point
│   ├── composer.json      <- PHP dependencies
│   ├── nixpacks.toml      <- Railway build config
│   ├── railway.json       <- Railway deployment config
│   ├── .railwayignore     <- Files to ignore during build
│   ├── Src/               <- Your PHP application code
│   └── DB/                <- Database files
├── config.yml             <- Rasa files (ignored by Railway)
├── domain.yml
└── ... (other Rasa files)
```

### 2. Updated Configuration:
- **nixpacks.toml**: Changed server command to serve from current directory (`.`)
- **All web files**: Moved to `web/` subdirectory

## Next Steps:

### 1. Configure Railway:
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Click on your PHP web application service
3. Go to "Settings" or "Deploy" tab
4. Find "Root Directory" or "Build Directory" setting
5. Set it to: `web`

### 2. Deploy:
1. Commit and push these changes to your Git repository
2. Railway will automatically redeploy using the `web/` directory as root

### 3. Your Environment Variables:
Keep your existing environment variables - they don't need to change:
```
DATABASE_URL = mysql://root:qRWWKoYkMSIxBKCCFtYETdSdLFterWpb@mysql.railway.internal:3306/railway
```

## Benefits of This Structure:
- ✅ Clean separation between web app and other components (Rasa)
- ✅ Railway only builds what it needs (PHP files)
- ✅ Easier to manage different services in the same repository
- ✅ Better organization for future development

Your web application will work exactly the same way, but now it's properly organized!
