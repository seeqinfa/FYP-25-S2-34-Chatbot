Need to install Python3.9, currently testing with Python 3.9.13.

Instructions for Rasa Initialization are as follows:
	1. Install Python 3.9.13
 	2. 'py -3.9 -m venv .venv' is run to make a virtual environment using python 3.9
  	3. '.venv\Scripts\activate' is used to use the venv
   	4. 'pip install rasa' installs rasa
Since Rasa is already initialized that step can be skipped.
